# PDF-Book-converter
This desktop application allows to user convert a pdf-file to sqlite database with automatically separating chapters of the book and correcting  lines in order to the texts to be suitable for TextView(android)
The main table of the database is kitob_sahifa
The requirements for the correct work of the app are as follows:
  - The book needs to have chapters
  - You need to have a copy of the database(it's in the project folder) with  certain tables created but without filling them
  - The Language is Tajik 
  
The app is not stable!
