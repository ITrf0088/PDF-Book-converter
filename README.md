# PDF-Book-converter
This desktop application allows the user convert a pdf-file to sqlite database with automatically separating chapters of the book and correcting  lines in order to the texts to be suitable for TextView(android)
The main table of the database is kitob_sahifa
The requirements for the correct work of the app are as follows:
  - The book needs to have chapters
  - You need to have a copy of the database with  certain tables created(it's in the project folder) but without filling them
  - The Language is Tajik 
  
The app is not stable! and was written for task solving
